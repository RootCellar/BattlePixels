# BattlePixels

## Brief

Basis for the PixelEngine.

## Timeline of sorts

### 9/2/2020

Uploaded the most recent version of the game.

This is a game written by me (RootCellar) in about 2018. The game was essentially a concept to learn how to draw simple, pixelated graphics to the screen in java, and make a fully functioning game.

The game is not actually finished though. I added a boss and flags that were intended to be capturable, but nothing actually happens when either the boss is killed or the flag is captured. The boss simply respawns, and you keep fighting.

To that point, the game is endless. It has also been described as a "bullet hell". It does contain a few classes though, to at least make it somewhat interesting with their concept ideas.

The classes were intended to be balanced. Through regular playing, though, you'll discover that the charger class is EASILY the most powerful. Go ahead, try it.

This project was essentially abandoned, but not before the basic parts were used to create the basis of the PixelEngine, also on Github.

I am hopeful that I will either revive this project, or use the PixelEngine to "remaster" it and turn it into a full game. This was indeed my first game with graphics, and, as such, I will always remember this game.

### December 2019

Revisited multiplayer idea, made it work successfully. The results of that may influence possible future development of this game (hence why that is listed here).

### December 2018

Attempt to make PixelEngine support multiplayer. It was functional, but extremely slow.

### 2018

This game was made starting in early 2018, just as a concept. I worked on it over the course of several months, adding things like a flag and even a boss, but it was never finished.

Late 2018 (October or so), the game was extracted to start the PixelEngine. It has since then been abandoned.

(so abandoned that the most recent code wasn't even on github!)
